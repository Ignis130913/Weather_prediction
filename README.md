Simple Weather Prediction with Ridge Regression
In my first machine learning project, I used Ridge Regression, a type of linear regression, to predict weather conditions. The model considers features like precipitation, temperature, and more.

Data Exploration
Before diving into predictions, I explored the data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA helped me understand missing values, outliers, and how features correlate.

Data Preprocessing
I handled missing values strategically and addressed outliers to ensure the model's reliability.

Feature Engineering
Inspired by EDA, I created new features to enhance the model's predictive power, capturing interactions between variables.

Ridge Regression
I chose Ridge Regression for its ability to handle multicollinearity, a common issue in linear regression.

Model Validation
Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, I validated the model's accuracy, ensuring its predictions align with actual outcomes.

Conclusion
This project marks a humble beginning in weather prediction, where a straightforward Ridge Regression model stands ready to forecast with practicality and simplicity.
